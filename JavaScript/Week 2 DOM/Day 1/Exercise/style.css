/* Task:

Create a new folder and add an index.html, style.css and app.js to it. Add your HTML boilerplate and correctly link the three files.

Add a h1 element to your HTML with the an “id” attribute of title.

Add some CSS rules to your stylesheet inside a class or id selector, to be applied to a new element later.

Using JavaScript I would like you to query the DOM, selecting the h1 element and storing it in a variable. 
Add the corresponding class or id attribute to the element in order for it to match the CSS rules already written in your CSS file. 
I would also like you to update the text content of your title element to say something new.

Using the DOM I want you to add a ul to your page, then create and add three li’s to your ul. Then using a loop add some styling all of your list items.

Finally I want you to use JavaScript to remove your page title element. */
